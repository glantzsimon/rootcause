<p>
    Many ancient civilisations had a more in-depth understanding of the cosmic male and female energies that underpin our reality. There are many different terms used to describe these cosmic energies, such as Shakti / Shiva in Sanskrit or Yin and Yang, as described in the 'Great Principle' in the Chinese tradition. However, they are all essentially understood to be on the one hand feminine, dark, passive energy and on the other masculine light, active energy.

    Yang energy moving from the stars changes in quality over a 9 year period, influencing many aspects of life on Earth
</h5>
<p>
    In 9 Star Ki, it is believed that the Yang energy of the universe is channelled to Earth via nine stars: Vega, Polaris and the seven stars of the Big Dipper (part of the Great Bear). The energy emanating from these stars has a different quality at different times, moving cyclically like the seasons. The different qualities of the Yang energy affects many aspects of our reality on Earth, such as the climate, weather patterns, seasons and subtler effects such as those on human consciousness and our natural life cycles. the and giving rise to the concept of seasons. Ancient peoples also understood that the Yin energies emanating from the earth shaped our physical environment. It is the interaction between the energy of the universe and the energy of the earth that was believed to influence the energetic dynamic of the year in which we were born, thus influencing our character.

<h5>
    Yin energy rises from the Earth in the spring, Yang energy descends from the heavens in the Autumn
</h5>
<p>
    Yin energy rises from the Earth in the spring, expanding and reaching its fullest expression in high summer. In the autumn, Yang energy descends from the heavens to the earth, cooling, consolidating and contracting the energy. The energy reaches its densest and most inactive state in mid winter, which represents the pure potential for the next cycle's period of growth that will come in the spring.

<h5>
    Each of the 9 Energies is considered Yin or Yang
</h5>
<p>
    Each of the nine Energies is either Yin or Yang. This binary classification is the simplest and most fundamental layer to the 9 Star Ki system. It should be pointed out that using such a simple classifiction does not yield precise or detailed picture about a particular Energy, but it is helpful to understand the concept of Yin and Yang when considering 9 Star Ki.

<h5>
    Nothing in the Universe is entirely Yin or Yang. 
</h5>
<p>
    In Nature, nothing is entirely Yin or entirely Yang. The Yin Yang symbol expresses this perfectly, with each half containing a piece of the opposite at its core. A tree has a trunk, branches and leaves, which represent the Yin element. Its roots, on the other hand, go deep into the ground, and represent the Yang.
</p>

<p>
    Someone who is more emotionally or spiritually oriented could be said to be more Yin, whereas someone who is more rational, practical and grounded is more Yang.
</p>

<h5>
    Winter and the night are more Yin. Summer and thee day are more Yang.
</h5>
<p>
    The winter, when it's dark and cold outside, is more Yin. This is a time when we are more passive and introverted. The summer, when there is more light and warmth, is more Yang. This is a time when we are more active and extroverted. A similar distinction can be made between the day and the night.
